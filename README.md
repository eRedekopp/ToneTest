# ToneTest

### About

ToneTest is an Android application that I wrote in the summer of 2017 while working for the HCI lab 
in the University of Saskatchewan.
This was just after the second year of my CS degree, and I didn't even know what a thread was when I started writing this.
At the time of this writing it is the biggest project I have ever worked on, and I did it alone with little supervision.
I probably learned more writing this application than I ever have in a class.
Not just learning how to write for Android, but learning how to quickly and effectively
find answers in documentation, using Git properly (didn't always do the best job though. Yikes!), organizing a larger project, 
proper OOP on something other than a toy project, using statistics in a practical situation, 
staying on task while spending 8-hour days programming, and so much more.

The project is unfinished as it stands in this repository. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, in-person tests
are not allowed at the time of this writing (May 2020) and so this study will not be run until after I graduate. I have written notes for my
successor in the Documentation directory, which describe how the application is stuctured and what work might need to
be done next. Despite not being completely finished, it still works and can be built and installed on an Android device.

### What it does

ToneTest is an application that tests users on their ability to hear tones, and uses that to build a model of
their hearing in that particular background noise environment. The idea is to be able to estimate the probability
of a user hearing a given tone at a given volume, so that we can model the user's hearing in various environments
and eventually choose appropriate system sounds ("earcons") and volumes depending on the background noise environment 
in which the user finds themself. More details can be found in the Documentation directory.
