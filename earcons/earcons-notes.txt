All files have amplitude normalized using ffmpeg-normalize 1.15.1 /// ffmpeg 4.1.3
Two passes of normalization by EBU R128 standard

Note: These earcons were created in bulk as quickly as possible, and so they have not
necessarily all been individually listened to and verified (at least some almost certainly
did not export properly). Be sure to listen to each .wav file before using it in a study

Earcons:
  Timbres:
    - clav   = clavinet             - Logic Pro X "seventies clav"
    - mari   = marimba              - Logic Pro X "marimba"
    - pno    = piano                - Logic Pro X "Yamaha Grand Piano"
    - saw    = sawtooth sine        - Logic Pro X ES2 sawtooth waveform default
    - sine   = pure sine            - Logic Pro X EXS24 blank settings
    - square = square sine          - Logic Pro X ES2 square waveform default
    - wurlie = wurlitzer e-piano    - Logic Pro X "wurlitzer classic"
  Classes:
    - chrom  = chromatic scale (7 notes)
    - maj3   = major third interval (2 notes)
    - neg    = "negative" tone, minor 2nd interval played twice
    - scale  = major scale followed by major triad "tada"
    - spooky = major triad and diminished triad of same root (order depends on direction)
    - susp   = major triad and sus4 triad of same root (order depends on direction)
    - triad  = first inversion major triad arpeggio
  Direction / Rhythm:
    - down-*   = notes get lower throughout the earcon
    - up-*     = notes get higher throughout the earcon
    - *-short  = quick earcon / short notes
    - *-long   = notes are exactly double the length of short
    - *-rhythm = notes are played as some syncopated rhythm, different than short/long rhythms
  Frequencies:
    - Fundamental frequency of the first note of the earcon
    - If first 'note' is a chord, based on lowest note in voicing
    - Special case: 'susp' frequency based on first "moving note",
      eg. Cmaj -> Csus4 frequency is the E /// Csus4 -> Cmaj frequency is the F

Directories:
Sorted by timbre
            earcon class
              direction + rhythm

Filenames:
filename = {frequency}Hz{timbre}{earcon class}{dir}{rhythm}.wav - all lowercase except Hz
