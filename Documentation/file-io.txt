Information about how hearing tests are stored in persistent storage.
It is highly recommended that you read hearing-tests.txt before reading this document


####################################################### Overview #######################################################

All file I/O is performed through the FileIOController. Before starting a test, we call setCurrentCalib() or
setCurrentConf() to make sure that we're saving to the right file, then we use saveTestHeader() to write in the test
header, saveLine() for each tone tested, then saveTestEnd to indicate that the test has completed successfully.

Individual participant files are kept in one folder per participant, which contains a single calibration file containing
information about all calibrations taken by this participant, and one file per confidence test.

When logging in a new participant, if the participant already exists, then we load their calibration data into a
HearingTestResultsCollection using the long, gross function FileIOController.loadParticipantData(). If the participant
doesn't already exist, we create a folder for them and create an empty Calibration file in that folder. This happens in
InitActivity via the FileIOController.


##################################################### File Format ######################################################

Calibration result file (one per participant):
    Named Calibration_N where N is the participant number

    START-TEST <DATE> <TEST-TYPE> <NOISE>
    <TIME> <FREQ> <VOL> <DIRECTION> <CORRECT?> <NUM-CLICKS> <CLICK-STRING>
    <TIME> <FREQ> <VOL> <DIRECTION> <CORRECT?> <NUM-CLICKS> <CLICK-STRING>
    <TIME> <FREQ> <VOL> <DIRECTION> <CORRECT?> <NUM-CLICKS> <CLICK-STRING>
    ...
    END-TEST
    START-TEST <DATE> <TEST-TYPE> <NOISE>
    ...
    END-TEST
    ...

    A ramp test contains 2 lines per frequency: one for each ramp-up


Confidence result file (one per test):
    Named Confidence_DATE_N where DATE is the current date/time and N is the participant number

    START-TEST <TEST-TYPE> <NOISE> <DATE>
    <TIME> <FREQ> <VOL> <DIRECTION> <CORRECT?> <NUM-CLICKS> <CLICK-STRING>
    ...
    END-TEST

    After the lines for each tone, we call compareToConfidenceTest() on the current participant's
    HearingTestResultsCollection and insert the results at the bottom of the file. This compares our model's predictions
    for how often the user would hear the tone compared to how often they actually did.

    These results are intended to be read by a human. We include information about clicks and everything else for the
    sake of having the data available and so that future programmers can load Calibration files if they want to.
