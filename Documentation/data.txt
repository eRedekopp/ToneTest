PARTICIPANTS

A "participant" is an individual person who has taken or will take hearing tests with this application. A participant is
assigned a directory on whichever device this application is being run on when they are first logged in. In that
directory is a single "calibration file" in which the participant's Calibration Test results are stored. A line is
saved in that file for every tone that is played in the test, containing information about the tone and the user's
response to it. A line is saved before and after the test to indicate the beginning and end of the test. Ramp, Reduce,
and Calibration tests are saved as separate tests. At login time, data is loaded from this calibration file into a
Participant object which will be used until the user switches participants or exits the application. Each confidence
test is saved in an individual file in the user's directory, and contains human-readable statistical data at the end of
the file.
