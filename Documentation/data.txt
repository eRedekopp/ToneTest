Information about how hearing test results are stored at runtime
It is highly recommended that you read hearing-tests.txt before reading this document.
For information on how test results are saved to disk, see file-io.txt.


##################################################### Participants #####################################################

A "participant" is an individual person who has taken or will take hearing tests with this application. At login time,
a Participant object is created, and if there are any, Calibration results are loaded into it. This way, a participant
can do a calibration one day, then come back another day for confidence tests.

A Participant contains all the calibration tests that this individual has taken, but does not store confidence test
results (those are intended to be read by humans from the files on disk). More precisely, a Participant contains a
single HearingTestResultsCollection, described below under "storing test results"


######################################################## Clicks ########################################################

The Click class originally represented just a touchscreen button press (or "click"), but this class now represents any
user input intended to indicate whether they heard a tone. This can be a touchscreen button press, a volume button
press, or a "shake" event. See interaction.txt for more information about how users can respond to tones played by this
application.

The Click class stores the time in milliseconds since the epoch at which the user interaction was registered, the answer
indicated by the user, and whether the event came through a touchscreen button press or through a shake/volume event.

Each tone played by a hearing test has a set of 0 or more Click objects that were registered during or immediately
following the tone being played, which are stored in that tone's SingleTrialResult (below)


################################################## SingleTrialResult ###################################################

A SingleTrialResult stores information about one individual tone played one time. This includes the time at which the
tone was played, the Click objects registered during the tone, whether the user was correct, and any other information
that we need to keep track of. These are stored inside a HearingTestResults object of some sort.


################################################# Storing Test Results #################################################

Final hearing test results are stored in a special container class, found in the HearingTest.Container module. A
meta-container for storing the results of many hearing tests is provided by the HearingTestResultsCollection class. Each
Participant has an associated HearingTestResultsCollection in which all of their tests taken to date (either performed
recently or read from a file) are stored.

The results of an individual hearing test are stored in an object inheriting from the HearingTestResults abstract class.
One notable child of the HearingTestResults class is the PredictorResults abstract class, which contains the results of
any hearing test whose results can be used to make predictions about tones not necessarily performed in the test itself
(ie. CalibrationTest and RampTest).

All non-abstract child classes of HearingTestResults implement a function called addResult(). This is not declared as
an abstract function because different subclasses have slightly different parameters for it. During a test, the result
of whether or not a participant heard an individual tone is added using this addResult() function.


RampTestResults and floor info

    The RampTestResults class is not often used, except to indicate that a test was only a ramp test and no reduce test
    was performed. While performing a RampTest, the results are stored into a RampTestResultsWithFloorInfo class, which
    inherits from RampTestResults but also has fields in which to store the results of a reduce test. After performing a
    RampTest, we store the results into a HearingTestResultsCollection as RampTestResults using
    RampTesResultsWithFloorInfo.getRegularRampResults().

    After performing a ReduceTest (which necessarily must be performed immediately following a RampTest), we find the
    results of the previously-performed RampTest, then store the ReduceTestResults (in the form of an array of
    FreqVolPairs, rather than its own Results object) into the RampTestResultsWithFloorInfo from the last test using
    the setReduceResults() method, then add the RampTestResultsWithFloorInfo directly to the
    HearingTestResultsCollection without modifying it. Internally, the RampTest class uses a RampTestResults class. This
    is mostly a legacy thing and doesn't serve any purpose outside of the internals of the class itself. To load the
    results of a ReduceTest from a file, use the ReduceTest.ResultsBuilder class, add the results with addResult(),
    then call builder.build().getResults() to get the results in a form suitable for adding to a
    RampTestResultsWithFloorInfo.


################################################## Using Test Results ##################################################

Confidence test results are stored in files and are never added to a Participant object. The application does some
analysis of the confidence test versus the predicted values from the calibration tests, but only does this immediately
after a confidence test. If you decide that you want to do extra processing on ConfidenceTestResults and save them with
the Participant, a rough guide on that is provided in future.txt. More information on confidence test files can be
found in file-io.txt.

PredictorResults are the only ones saved with a HearingTestResultsCollection object, and they are used for two purposes
in this system:

    Selecting tones for a Confidence Test
        Tones for a confidence test are selected by first finding the PredictorResults with the most similar background
        noise to the background noise of the confidence test, then using the getVolFloorEstimate() and
        getVolCeilingEstimate() functions in those PredictorResults to find volumes. This all happens by simply using
        the getVol[Floor/Ceiling]Estimate() functions built into the HearingTestResultsCollection class. Confidence test
        tones are configured in that test's configureTestTones() method.

    Predicting the probability of hearing a tone that was not tested
        Getting P(heard) for a tone can be done through the getProbability method. If the predictor results can make
        more than one prediction, this falls back on some default. The more important method is getPredictionString,
        which makes one or more predictions about the probability of hearing a tone, then formats it as a string with
        the different predictions labelled if necessary.

As stated above, some PredictorResults can make more than one prediction. This mainly concerns the RampTest. Since the
RampTest has so much less information than the CalibrationTest, we might need to do a bit more trial-and-error. This
way, we can predict using any arbitrary number of techniques, then print them all out through the getPredictionString()
method to figure out which one works best.

We typically don't directly use a PredictorResults once we've added all of the results to it. PredictorResults are
usually accessed through their HearingTestResultsCollection, mostly through the compareToConfidenceTest() or
getVol[Floor/Ceiling]Estimate() methods.


############################################### Computing Probabilities ################################################

CalibrationTestResults

    The logic for this is found in the various overrides of CalibrationTestResults.getProbability(). Simply, it finds
    the frequencies tested immediately below and above the requested frequency, finds what percentage of the way between
    two it is, then predicts that the probability will be that same proportion of the way between the two probabilities.

    For example, if we call getProbability(freq = 500Hz, vol = 1.0) and during our calibration we tested 250Hz and
    750Hz, then we would find the probability of hearing 250Hz and 750Hz at the given volume (described below), say
    250Hz = 0.3 and 750Hz = 0.5. Since 500Hz is 50% of the way between 250Hz and 750Hz, then the probability of hearing
    it is 50% of the way between 0.3 and 0.5; that is, 0.4.

    Finding the probability of hearing a tone that we DID test at an arbitrary volume is similar: find the volumes that
    we tested just above and below the queried volume, find the percentage of the way between, then return a number that
    same percentage of the way between the two experimentally-derived probabilities from the calibration data.


RampTestResults

    We find estimates for volumes at which we will hear the tone 100% of the time and 0% of the time via the
    getVol[Floor/Ceiling]Estimate() functions, then compute the probability based on the queried volume's distance
    between those two estimates. RampTestResults contains the functions getProbabilityLinear and
    getProbabilityLogarithmic which use different functions to find the probability based on its distance between the
    two volumes. Simply calling getProbability() returns the linear function, but both are shown in
    getPredictionString().

    This is also in RampTestResultsWithFloorInfo, which overrides the getVolFloorEstimate() method to reflect its extra
    data.


Both of these contain half-implemented or implemented but unused methods for computing probabilities for various
different types of tones. Currently we just use the frequency and volume, but you could very easily change the way
they're implemented to predict differently based on the type of tone.

Some rough guidelines on how to edit the way that this application computes P(heard) or how it compares PredictorResults
to ConfidenceTestResults can be found in future.txt
