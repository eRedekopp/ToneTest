Description of the background noise generator


####################################################### Overview #######################################################

Background noise is generated in the BackgroundNoiseController class. This class has its own MediaPlayer and does not
rely on the Model to play noise. When requested, the BackgroundNoiseController starts a thread that plays background
noise independently of everything else going on in the application. The generator continuously writes background noise
to its track until it notices that HearingTestInteractionModel.testing is no longer True, then it turns itself off.

The generator can play white noise, which just writes random gaussians to the line out to create static. It can also
play "crowd noise", which loops the sound of a crowd in a busy restaurant.

The volume of the noise is passed to the BackgroundNoiseGenerator as an integer from 0 to 100, but internally the
generator converts that to a number between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. The volume is a multiplier which decides by how
much to amplify the wavelengths of the sound.
