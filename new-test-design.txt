1. Perform ramp test
2. Reduce until not heard
3. Choose tested frequencies from slightly below not-heard
   volume to ramp-test volumes
4. Test each frequency some number of times
5. Estimate sigmoid curve from results

Results will be in the form of a new Object which has, for each frequency,
a list of volumes and whether they were heard at that volume. These
results will be used to estimate the sigmoid
