Running tests:


Calibration:
    Register "calibration" click in MainActivity
    Go to CalibSelectActivity, return with integer IDs for all selected options
        - or just end here if user cancelled in CalibSelectActivity screen
    Return to MainActivity, and pass the selected IDs to HearingTestController.calibrationTest()
    Select the appropriate test types and put into the HearingTestInteractionModel
        - 1 to 3, depending on user's selection. Set as fields in the iModel so we know which tests to run later on
        - set the first test as iModel.currentTest
        - null any tests that are not going to be run
    Set the test to paused, show the test information in a dialog to the user, then notifySubscribers() when done.
        - This causes MainActivity to call HearingTestController.checkForHearingTestResume(), which starts whichever
          test was put on deck by HearingTestController.calibrationTest() to begin
    Once the first test is complete, control is passed to to HearingTestController.*TestComplete, which saves the
        results of the test and starts the next test, if there is one
    If a user pauses during a test, execution hangs until the user un-pauses, at which time notifySubscribers() is
        called and the test is resumed as described above

    Note: multi-test suites are always executed in the following order: Ramp -> reduce -> calibration
        - because later tests depend on information from previous ones.
        - information may be taken from a previous test suite with the same noise type and volume, if needed

Confidence:
    Basically the same as calibration except there is only 1 test to be run, and there are more options for timbres and
    types, and we get options from user in ConfSelectActivity

Login screen:

    New Participant
        - Use ID in text box
        - If participant with that number already exists, ask to overwrite
            - Archive old file, just in case
    Load Participant
        - Use ID in text box
        - If noticed a half-finished test, ask to resume (in case of crashes)
    Skip This Step
        - Login with default user

The login screen returns to the main activity with only a participant ID. Participant files are guaranteed to exist when
control returns to the main activity - if creating a new participant, empty files are created by the login screen before
returning. Files are loaded via the FileIOController from MainActivity after returning

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Files:

Individual participant files are kept in one folder per participant, which contains a single calibration file containing
information about all calibrations taken by this participant, and one file per confidence test

Calibration result file (one per participant):
    Named Calibration_N where N is the participant number

    START-TEST <TEST-TYPE> <NOISE> <DATE>
    <TIME> <FREQ> <VOL> <DIRECTION> <CORRECT?> <NUM-CLICKS> <CLICK-STRING>
    ...
    END-TEST

Confidence result file (one per test):
    Named Confidence_DATE_N where DATE is the current date/time and N is the participant number

    START-TEST <TEST-TYPE> <NOISE> <DATE>
    <TIME> <FREQ> <VOL> <DIRECTION> <CORRECT?> <NUM-CLICKS> <CLICK-STRING>
    ...
    END-TEST

    ResultsAsString, like in the previous version
