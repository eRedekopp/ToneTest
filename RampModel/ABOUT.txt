These are some personal notes on some research I did into the data from ramp tests and how we might be able to use it to
get rid of the CalibrationTest. I did this like 9 months ago and I don't remember everything, I just remember that it
looked a little more like a log function than a linear one so I came up with that function at the bottom of this
document, which we now use in the RampTestResults object.


Results.csv contains, in the first line, all the x values of the data,
and in all subsequent lines, y data, or nothing if no y data for that x 
value. Contains results for all trials of pilot1 and pilot2 where both a 0% 
and 100% audible volume were found. results.txt is to be used by 
draw_psychometric.py to draw a graph of the data.

x data are given as a proportion of the way between the 0% and 100% volume
y data are given as P(heard) at that volume

The data appears to roughly follow y = x, or possibly y = ln((e-1)x + 1. Will
build models using both
