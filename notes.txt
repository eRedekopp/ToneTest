Todo:
	- System.currentTimeMillis() for more accurate click registration?
    - Look into improving audio (android dev site "high performance audio")
        - Write bigger buffers?
        - Sine wave : write entire sine at once?
        - Calling play() at the wrong time?
        - Something to do with pausing/unpausing the line a bunch?
    - Save confidence analysis in different file than test results
    - Look into whether internal mixer affects waveform
    - Improve code aesthetics / code style / documentation / write developer guide
    - Find a way to eliminate break in crowd noise (low priority) (silence at end of wav?)
    - Normalize background noise types to same volume scale as sines/earcons (wait to hear from Carl about final
      test format - don't bother if we aren't using the background noise generator in the real thing)

Confidence tests to add:
    - <DONE> Sine interval
    - <DONE> Sine earcon
    - <DONE> Piano Single Tone
    - Wav earcon (audibility)
    - Wav earcon (differentiation)
    - <DONE> Single-sine w/ tested frequencies
    - Piano tested frequencies
Calibration tests to add:
    - <DONE> Piano

Notes on audio synthesis:
    - see "High-Performance Audio" page on developer.android.com - improve playSine?
        - use native c++ code?
        - Math.sin() has bad performance with large x - if still using java, maybe force x to stay small
    - PureData (libpd) for complex tone synthesis?
        - FM synthesis only
    - Other ARM synthesis libraries?
    - built in sonivox EAS synth
        - android.google.com search for sonivox
        - https://github.com/billthefarmer/mididriver eas midi driver
        - Can we know the exact waveform?
            -  Get access to the raw PCM data?
    - Probably a better idea to just download different instrument sample packs and restrict
      ourselves to "musical note" frequencies
        - UIowa instrument samples normalized to fill full range of 16-bit PCM for single-tone tests
            - Did not work - too long and not clear enough, way too much silence at end + difficult to trim
        - Homemade earcons for earcon tests
