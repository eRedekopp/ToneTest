How do we control for false alarms?
  - Ask carl? Need incentive to force one way or another?
Constructing 95% CI for confidence trial
  - Stats textbook p395
  - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/urltj90ojf
    - size of confidence interval as function of test proportion
  - n = 20 trials per FVP gives 95% CI with width 8% to 20%

    - Need a huge number of trials to get any sort of accuracy
  - stats textbook p452 type II error probabilities


Earcon models tried:
    - n=50 samples of 1000 using only most prominent frequency from each:
            - Guesses within ~30%
            - Inconsistent: wrong in both directions
    - n=2 samples from very beginning and very end:
            - Close for low frequencies but off by ~40% for higher probabilities
            - Guesses low, generally
            - Doesn't seem to generate probabilities over 50%
    - Above, except cuts off last 2000 samples from earcon
            - Actually somewhat accurate
            - Frequencies from periodogram are not even close to actual frequencies, end frequency always 8.0
